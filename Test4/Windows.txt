Gman-Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that 
you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.
And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets 
just say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make 
all the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the 
ashes.

(The gman slowly fades away into the background and his image is replaced with 
the viewpoint of Gordon Freeman on a train pulling into a station)

Citizen 1-I didnt see you get on.  This is my third transfer this year.
Citizen 2-No matter how many times I get relocated I never get used to it.
(the train pulls into the station and stops)
Citizen 1-Well, end of the line.
(as Gordon gets off the train he is scanned by a small flying device, a large 
monitor with a face on it begins to speak)
02          . :H@@@MM@M#H/.,+%;,
Monitor/Breen-Welcome, welcome to city 17, you have chosen or been chosen to 
relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers.  I thought so much of 
city 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the citadel so 
thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I have been proud to call city 17 my 
home. So whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts 
unkown, welcome to city 17, it is safer here.
14   /%+%$XHH@$=              , .H@@@@MX,

Civil Patrol-First warning move away.
Citizen 3-It, Its all I have left.
(the civil patrolman shoves the citizen into his luggage)
Civil Patrol-Move it.
Citizen 3-Alright, alright I am moving, jeez.

Citizen 4-Were you the only ones on that train? Overwatch stopped our train in 
the woods and took my husband for questioning.  They said he would be on the 
next train, I am not sure when that was.  They are being nice and letting me 
wait though.
15    .=--------.           -%H.,@@@@@MX,
16    .%MM@@@HHHXX$$$%+- .:$MMX -M@@MM%.
Citizen 5-Dont drink the water, they, they put something in it to make you 
forget, I dont even remember how I got here.

Citizen 6-Dr. Breen again? I was hoping I had seen the last of him in city 14.
Citizen 7- I wouldnt say that to loud, this is his base of operations.

(Gordon looks down to the end of the checkpoint where he sees citizens
being led through)
Civil Patrol 2-You, Citizen come with me.
Citizen 8-Wai, Wait a minute where are you...
Civil Patrol 2-GET IN HERE!
Civil Patrol 2- Go on!
Citizen 8-ME?
Civil Patrol 2-I SAID MOVE!

(Gordon comes to a fenced in area, a civil patrolman blocks his path, he goes 
the other way and when he enters the caged area both doors shut and an alarm 
sounds, he is scanned by a camera)

Civil Patrol 3-Dont move, hold it
(the side door opens)
Civil Patrol 4-You citizen, come with me.
(Gordon follows him down a hallway, as he looks into a room he can see a 
citizen being intterogated)
Citizen 9-This must be a mistake, I got a standard relocation coupon just like 
everyone else.
(before Gordon can see anything more the civil patrol man in this room shuts 
the viewing slot on the door)

(Gordon comes to the last door in the hall way, the civil patrolman knocks on 
the door and it opens to reveal another civil patrolman)
Civil Patrol 4-Get in! Need any help with this one?
Civil Patrol 5-No I am good
(Civil Patrolman 4 leaves the room)
Civil Patrol 5-Back up!
Civil Patrol 5-Yeah I am gonna need me some privacy for this
(civil patrolman 5 uses his console to turn off the 2 cameras in the room)
Civil Patrol 5-Now...
(the civil patrolman takes off his helmet and reveals himself to be barney)
Barney-About that beer I owed ya. Its me Gordon, barney from black mesa. 
Sorry for the scare I had to put on a show for the cameras. I have been
working undercover with civil protection, I cant take too long or they will 
get suspicious, I am way behind on my beating quota
(a man in a lab coat appears on the screen on the console in front of barney)
Dr. Kliener-Yes barney what is it? I am in the middle of a critical test.
Barney-Sorry doc, but look whos here.
Dr. Kliener-Great Scott! Gordon Freeman! I expected more warning.
Barney-Yeah you and me both doc. He was about to board the express train to 
Nova Prospekt.
Dr. Kliener-Well, Barney what do you intend to do?
Barney-Im thinking, Im thinking.
Dr. Kliener-Alyx is around here somewhere, she would have an idea of how to
get him here.
Barney-Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay.  
Listen I gotta go doc, we are taking enough chances as it is.
Dr. Kleiner-Very well. And eh Gordon? Its good to see you.
(the monitor shuts off)
Barney-Okay Gordon your going to have to make your way to Dr. Klieners lab.
(there is a loud knocking at the door)
Barney-Oh man! That is what I was afraid of! Get in here Gordon! Before you 
blow my cover!
(barney releases the lock on the back door)
Barney-Pile up some stuff to get to that window and keep going till your in
the plaza. I will meet up with you later.

(Gordon escapes out the window and arrives at another building, a civil 
patrolman blocks his only path, he knocks a can over)
Civil Patrol 6-Pick up that can. Now put it in the trash can.
(reluctantly Gordon puts it in the trash can)
Civil Patrol 6-Alright you can go.


(Gordon comes to a large plaza, with gates branching to different areas of the 
city, he continues past the plaza outside, beyond the plaza lies a extremely 
large building, he makes his way down the street to a area with 2 buildings,
one of the entrances is guarded by civil patrolman)
Citizen 10-This is how it always starts, first one building, then the entire 
block.
Citizen 11-They have no reason to come to our place.
Citizen 10-Dont worry, they will find one.
(Gordon enters the entrance of the non-guarded building)

(as he makes his way up the stairs he sees a group of 4 civil patrolmen knock 
down a door and rush in too a room, he enters the adjacent room)
Citizen 12-Oh, I thought you were a cop.
Citizen 13-Dont worry he is one of us.
Citizen 12-Look at them down there.
Citizen 13-I told you they would be coming for us next!
Citizen 12-Just this once I hope you are wrong.

(as he makes his way further up the building a voice sounds)
Warning Voice-Attention residents, miscount detected in your sector
Citizen 14-Psst! Hey you! In here! Head for the roof! There is no time to lose!
Citizen 15-Run for your life!
Citizen 16-Civil Protection!
Citizen 17-CPs!
Citizen 16-Here they come!
(Civil protection starts raiding the building and Gordon runs for the roof 
along with other citizens)

Citizen 18-Get in here quick!
(the citizen shuts the door to the room and holds his body against it)
Citizen 18-Head for the roof! I will keep them busy!
(a chase ensues with Gordon running across a series of rooftops with civil 
protection chasing him)

(Gordon reaches a open window and goes inside, he heads down a staircase which 
collapses behind him, civil protection close in on him)
Alyx-Over Here! Ha! No you dont!
(the screen goes white and Gordon is knocked unconscious)
(as Gordon wakes up he sees alyx and the bodies of the CPs that were chasing 
him)
Alyx-Dr. Freeman I presume? We better hurry, the combine can be slow to wake, 
but once they are up you will have a hard time taking them down.
(alyx opens an elevator and Gordon heads down it along with her)
Alyx-Dr. Kliener said you might be coming this way. I dont think it occurred to 
him that you might not have a map.
Alyx-Im Alyx Vance, my father worked with you back in black mesa, but im sure 
you dont remember him.
Alyx-Man of few words arent you?
Alyx-Remember him from black mesa? Your old administrator?
(alyx gestures to a picture of the same man that was on the large monitor)
Aylx-Ha! Dont get my dad started on Dr. Breen.


==============================================================================
A Red Letter Day
==============================================================================

Aylx-Funny you showing up on this day in particular.
Aylx-We have been helping people escape the city on foot. Its a dangerous route 
to my fathers lab through the old canals, today we are finally on the verge of 
having a better way.
Alyx-Here lemme buy you a drink
(alyx puts a coin into a vending machine, the machine opens like a door to 
reveal a passage behind it that leads to Dr. Klieners lab)
Alyx-Oh and by the way, nice to finally meet you.

(Gordon enters the lab and sees Dr. Kliener)
Dr. Kliener-Blast that little.. where did she get to? Llamar? Come out of there.
Aylx-Uh-oh, everything alright Dr. Kliener?
Dr. Kliener-Oh, hello Alyx. Well almost alright, Llamar has gotten out of her 
crate again. If I didnt know better, I would suspect barney of trapping and..
My goodness, Gordon Freeman, It really is you isnt it?
Alyx-I found him wandering around outside, bit of a troublemaker isnt he?
Dr. Kliener-We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does seem to 
follow in his wake.
Dr. Kliener-I must say Gordon you have come at a very opportune time, Alyx has 
just installed the final piece in the resurrected teleport!
Alyx-I cant take any credit for the breakthrough doctor.
Dr. Kliener-Nonsense, your talents surpass your loveliness.
Aylx-Lets just see if this thing works ok?

(barney enters the lab)
Barney-Well is he here? There you are! Man Gordon you stirred up the hive!
Barney-We cant keep him here long doc, It will jeporadize everything we have 
worked for.
Alyx-Dont worry he is coming with me.
Dr. Kliener-Thats right Barney, this is a red letter day, we will inaugurate 
the new teleport with a double transmission.
Barney-You mean its working? For real this time? Because I still have 
nightmares about that cat.
Alyx-What cat?
Dr. Kliener-Now now there is nothing to be worried about, we have made major 
strides since then. Major strides.
Aylx-What cat?
Barney-Doc, since he is not taking the streets you might as well get him out
of his civvies.
Dr. Kliener-What? Oh dear you are right, I almost forgot. Barney I will give 
you the honor.
Barney-I have gotta get back on my shift but ok.

(barney uses a keypad to open up a garage like door, inside this small room 
there is a glass case which contains the HEV suit)
Barney-Here we go.. Awahh!
(Dr. Klieners pet headcrab Llamar jumps on barney)
Barney-Damn it! Get it off me!
Dr. Kliener-Llamar! There you are!
Barney-I though you got rid of that pest!
Dr. Kliener-Certainly not. Never fear Gordon, she is de-beaked and completely 
harmless. The worst she might try to do is couple with your head. Fruitlessly.
Llamar-Guwakkh!
Barney-Get that thing away from me!
Dr. Kliener-Here my pet. Hop up!
(Llamar jumps up onto a shelf with some crates and computers)
Dr. Kliener-No not up there!
Dr. Kliener-No, No! Careful Llamar those are quite fragile.
(Llamar jumps into a vent)
Dr. Kliener-Oh fie! It will be another week before I can coax here out of 
there!
Barney-Yeah. Longer if we are lucky.
Alyx-Barney.. You are not an animal person?
Barney-Ugh.
Dr. Kliener-Well Gordon go ahead, slip into your suit now.

(Gordon steps into the glass chamber and puts the HEV suit on)
Dr. Kliener-Well Gordon I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove, at 
least the glove parts do.
Dr. Kliener-I have made a few modifications, but I will just acquaint you with 
the essentials, now lets see..
(Dr. Kliener picks up a clipboard with a paper on it and begins reading from 
the paper)
Dr. Kliener-The Mark V Hazardous Environment Suit has been redesigned for 
comfort and utility..

(A loud alarm sounds in the background)
Dr. Kliener-Oh dear!
Barney-Doc we dont have time for this. At least get that suit juiced up Gordon.
Dr. Kliener-Good idea, there is a charger on the wall. I have modified your 
suit to draw power from combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever 
they patrol.
Aylx-Meanwhile, lets get this show on the road.

(Dr. Kliener moves a picture frame around, this opens up a retinal scanner 
which he uses to open up a secret room behind the wall, Gordon enters the room 
along with everyone else, inside is a large mass of computers and wires along 
with a platform in the middle of the room, Alyx gets onto the platform and the 
guard rails close behind her)
09  X@/ -$MM/                    .+MM@@@M$
Dr. Kliener-Gordon, why dont you position yourself near the panel over there 
and wait for my word?

(A man appears on a monitor behind barney)
Eli-Issac are you there?
Dr. Kiener-Yes, yes, Eli, a bit of a hold up on this end. You will never 
guess who found his way into our lab this morning.
Eli-Thats not who I think it is, is it?
Dr. Kliener-Indeed it is, and its our intention to send him packing straight 
away, in the company of your lovely daughter.
Aylx-Are you ready for us dad?
Eli-We are all set on this end.
Aylx-Then lets do it
(the platform Alyx is standing on begins to rise)
Dr. Kliener-Lets see, the massless field flux should self-limit and I have 
clamped the manifold parameters to include CY Hilbert and GC orbitfold 
inclusive. Conditions could not be more ideal.
Barney-Thats what you said last time.
Aylx-Hey, uh, yeah, about that cat..
08  =-./@M@M$                  .;@MMMM@MM:
Dr. Kliener-Initializing in three.. two.. one.. Oh fiddlesticks what now?
(One of the plugs comes lose out of its outlet)
Aylx-Uh, doctor the plug.
Dr. Kliener-Dear me, you are right, Gordon would you mind plugging us in.
(Gordon plugs the cord back in)
Alyx-You gonna let Gordon throw the switch?
Dr. Kliener-Gordon, go right ahead.
(Gordon throws the switch)
Dr. Kliener-Very good, final sequence commencing..now.
Barney-I cant look.
Alyx-Uh, ok, oh ah ohhh!

(Aylx disappears from the teleporter)
Dr. Kliener-Well, did it work?
Eli-See for yourself
Aylx-Hey doc!
05     ;@M@@M- XM@X;. -+XXXXXHHH@M@M#@/.
Dr. Kliener-Thank goodness, my relief is almost palpable
Eli-Fantastic work Izzy
Dr. Kliener-Well I cant take all the credit, Dr. Freeman proved an able 
assistant
Eli-Lets go ahead and bring Gordon through now.
Dr. Kliener-Right you are, speak to you again in a few moments.
Barney-Good job Gordon, throwing that switch and all, I can see your M.I.T.
education really pays off.
06   ,%MM@@MH ,@%=            .---=-=:=,.
Dr. Kliener-Alright Barney, your turn.
Barney-Gee thanks
Dr. Kliener-Gordon, as soon as you are in position we will send you to Eli.
(The loud alarm sounds again)
Barney-And not a moment too soon
(Gordon steps into the teleporter, the guardrails close and it begins to rise)
Dr. Kliener-Excellent, initializing, in three.. two.. one.., eh Barney if you 
would be so kind?
Barney-Good luck out there Gordon
Dr. Kliener-Yes indeed, we are ready to project you Gordon, best of luck in 
your future endeavors, and bon voyage, final sequence.
20                =++%%%%+/:-.

(An alarm begins to sound)
Barney-What the hell?
(Llamar jumps out of a vent a breaks some wires connected to the teleporter)
Dr. Kliener-What is it?
Barney-Its your pet the freaking head humper!
Dr. Kliener-Llamar? Hedy! No!
Barney-Look out!
(Llamar jumps onto the teleport as it begins to malfunction, Gordon is 
transported to a beach, then back to the lab)
Barney-There he is!
04      -+@MM; $M@@MH+-,;XMMMM@MMMM@+-
Dr. Kliener-Is Llamar with him?
Barney-Forget about that thing!
(Gordon is now transported to his intended destination)
Alyx-He is coming through dad!
Eli-What is going on Judith?
Judith-Im not sure, it seems to be some kind of interference.
Eli-Gordon stay put we will get ya out of there.
Judith-Something is drawing him away.
(Gordon is teleported into an unknown location, he sees the same man he saw on 
the monitor)

Breen-What is the meaning of this? Who are you? How did you get in here?
(Gordon is now teleported back to the lab)
Barney-He is back, Im getting him outta there.
Dr. Kliener-You cant just wade into the field! It will peel you apart!
Alyx-We just lost Gordon what is going on?
Dr. Kliener-I wish I knew, Im encountering unexpected interference
Barney-Dont worry Gordon we will..
(Gordon is transported back to his original destination)
Aylx-There he is!

Judith-Ah! We are losing him again!
(Gordon is transported back to the unknown location)
Breen-The man I saw, im all but certaint it was... Gordon Freeman
(Gordon is transported underwater, A giant alien comes rushing at him but he 
is transported again at the last second, this time he is outside of the lab
looking in through a window behind Dr. Kliener)

19          ,:+$+-,/H#MMMMMMM@- -,
Dr. Kliener-What do you mean he is not there?
Eli-He didnt come through.
Dr. Kliener-Then where is he?

Dr. Kliener-Ahh!
Eli-Shut it down! Shut it down!
Dr. Kliener-Gordon run! You must get out of here!
Barney-Get down outta sight I will come find you!

(Gordon makes his way through the area behind the lab until he sees barney on a 
ledge above)
03       ,/X+ +M@@M@MM%=,-%HMMM@X/,
Barney-Gordon! I have never seen the citadel on full alert like that! Take the 
old canals out of city 17 to Eli, its dangerous but there is a whole network
of resistance members who run the underground railroad. I would come with you 
but I have to look after Dr. Kliener. Oh and before I forget, I think you 
dropped this back at black mesa.
(Barney throws down a crowbar)
Barney-Good luck out there buddy, you are gonna need it.
(Gordon makes his way away from the lab and through a train station while 
being chased by civil protection)
